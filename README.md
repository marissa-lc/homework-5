homework 5 Day Planner

This project was to create a day planner ranging from 9:00am to 5:00pm

The purpose of this planner is to help schedule out your day by providing an hourly schedule where you can input your activity and save it to your planner.

The goal with this was to add moment. js so that the times would be color coded by past time, present time, and future time but I was having a lot of trouble understanding moment.js so I ended up not adding it.

I was also hoping to get the "activities" saved to local storage but could not remember how to do it properly.

I don't feel like I used the proper code I needed to make this project but I did my best to turn in something at least semi functional. I will be reviewing a few of the classes during the break to get myself back up to date with the code I am supposed to be using for these projects.
